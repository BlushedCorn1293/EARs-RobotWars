BattleBot Project - Electronics and Radio Society

Welcome to the repository for the BattleBot Project! This repository contains all the code for a BattleBot I am developing as part of the University Electronics and Radio Society. Our team of 7 members is building and programming this robot from scratch, working together to create a competitive and reliable bot for combat robotics events.

Project Overview

This BattleBot features a 4-bar flipper weapon that is powered by a motor-driven screw mechanism. The flipper is designed for offensive capabilities, allowing the bot to effectively flip opponents in the arena. The weapon mechanism is controlled by the code in this repository, which manages the motor that drives the flipper forward and retracts it as needed.
Team

The BattleBot team consists of 7 members from the Electronics and Radio Society, collaborating on various aspects including design, engineering, coding, and testing. Each team member contributes their skills to ensure a well-rounded and competitive robot.
Features

    4-Bar Flipper Weapon: A powerful flipper designed to toss and disable opponents, controlled by a custom motor-driven screw system.
    Motor Control: The code here manages the motor responsible for the precise movements of the weapon, ensuring accurate and timely actions during a match.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

    /control - Contains code for controlling the motor and flipper mechanism.
    /docs - Documentation related to the BattleBot's architecture and code structure.
    /testing - Scripts and tools used for testing the weapon functionality and overall bot performance.

How It Works

    Weapon Activation: The motor powers a threaded screw that drives the flipper forward.
    Flipper Retraction: When deactivated, the motor retracts the screw to reset the flipper position.
    Code Execution: The control code uses a combination of sensors (if available) and timing to manage the flipper's position and responsiveness.
